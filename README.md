- 👋 Hi, I’m Oliwer
- 👀 I'm a student of a Master's (MSc) in IT with Business Intelligence, I have a long-lasting interest in how computers work, specifically software engineering or data extraction, processsing, visualisation and analysis
- 🌱 I have experience in various technologies including (but not limited to) C#, R, ReactJS, ASP.NET, SQL 
- 💞️ I’m looking to spread my wings and experience work in the IT industry, especially in the healthcare sector as I'd love my work to help people who need it the most. I'm also interested in games development and starting my first ever gamedev project (TwinStickFarm) on GitHub!
- 📫 Contact me on oliwers2002@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an electronic music producer and audio engineer, I love creating and would be interested in collaborating!
